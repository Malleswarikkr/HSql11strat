Q11)Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
A)select city from station where city  REGEXP '^[AEIOU]' and city  REGEXP '[aeiou]$'
 //second way for solution
 select  distinct city from station where substr(city,1,1) in('A','E','I','O','U') and substr(city,-1,1) in('a','e','i','o','u')
 q12)Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
 A)select distinct city from station where city not REGEXP '^[AEIOU]'
 //second way isselect  distinct city from station where (city  not regexp '^[AEIOU]' AND city not regexp '[aeiou]$')

 select distinct city from station where substr(city,1,1) not in('A','E','I','O','U')
 q13)Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
 A)select  distinct city from station where (substr(city,1,1) not in('A','E','I','O','U') or
substr(city,-1,1) not in('a','e','i','o','u'))
//second way
select  distinct city from station where (city not regexp '^[AEIOU]' or city 
                                          not regexp '[aeiou]$')
  q14)Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels and do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

  //second
  select  distinct city from station where (city not regexp '^[AEIOU]' and city 
                                          not regexp '[aeiou]$')
